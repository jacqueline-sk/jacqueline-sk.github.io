          <em>Why near-death experiences like Skydiving are so much fun</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered what it must be like to see the mountains from
          a bird's view? Or the lakes? The ocean? Why not partner up with an
          experienced Skydiver and take off? <br /><br />
          First of all, let's clarify what Skydiving actually is:
          <span
            >Parachuting (or Skydiving) is a method of transiting from a high
            point to Earth with the aid of gravity, involving the control of
            speed during the descent using a parachute or parachutes. It may
            involve more or less free-falling (the skydiving segment) which is a
            period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body
            gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.</span
          >
          So much for Wikipedia's explanation. Basically, you'll experience
          three key phases of your jump:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>getting on the plane and taking off üõ´</strong>
            <p>
              First of all, you will meet your partner. They will make sure
              you're all geared up and will be your best friend for the next
              hour or so. Once your harness and other security gear are ready to
              go, it's time to get on the plane! Depending on the height you
              chose for your jump, the flight usually takes 15-30 minutes. Enjoy
              the scenery! Your guide is now double-checking the harness and
              ensures that you are very closely strapped to them (get ready to
              feel their ribs!). Once they give you the signal to get ready,
              just lean your head and legs back and
              <span>... enjoy the thrill!</span>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>jump & fall ‚úåüèΩ</strong>
            <p>
              When you're doing your very first skydive, the feeling is just
              indescribable - literally! Your brain has no scenario to compare
              this to, so you literally do. not. know. what to expect and what
              to do. Your survival instincts are deactivated. There's nothing
              else for you to do than look up and around and enjoy the scenery.
              In this phase, you're truly falling and rushing from the sky for
              about 30-60 seconds. (Author's note: My first guide explained to
              me that in this phase, g forces are somehow irrelevant, so you
              won't feel nauseous) At some point, your guide will pull the
              trigger and open the parachute.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>float & land ü™Ç</strong>
            <p>
              Now here comes the relaxing part! Once the parachute opened up,
              you're slowly gliding towards the earth. It's time to take off
              your security goggles and ear-protection. It will take a few
              minutes until you're touching ground, so your guide will likely
              explain a bit about the area and might perform a few spins and
              tricks. Now this is where you'll need a strong stomach!
              Unfortunately, even the most exciting Skydives have to come to an
              end, so listen to your guide's instructions for the landing. Made
              it safely back to earth? Congrats! How do you feel? <br /><span
                >... Do you want to go again?</span
              >
            </p>
